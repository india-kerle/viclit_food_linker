This is another recipe from Harumi Kurihara, reputedly sort of the Japanese parallel to Martha Stewart or Delia Smith. The cookbook was translated from Japanese to English in England, so all the recipes are British-style; I have tried to give some American approximations. Steaming is a common technique in Japanese cooking, and Ms. Kurihara has mastered the art of steaming in the microwave, offering specific times at specific wattages that actually work. I had to break out the instruction manual to my microwave to figure out the wattage. Steamed cake is a bit different in texture from baked and takes some getting used to for Americans, but this does taste much like cakes I have bought at Japanese and Korean style bakeries, and you can make them at home in the microwave. Ms. Kurihara offers two filling suggestions. I tried the peanut butter one, and found it to be exactly like fillings I have had at the aforementioned Japanese and Korean bakeries, but in those cases the cakes were plainer and drier; I thought it conflicted a bit with the cream cheese. I think these would be really good with dcwang wang's green tea mousse, recipe #103075, though I haven't tried that yet.

The Potteries, an area that is the birthplace of many famous people including Arnold Bennett, Sir Stanley Matthews, Reginald Mitchell, Captain Edward Smith of the Titanic, Josiah Wedgwood, and more recently Robbie Williams…….but just as important to the Potteries as Royal Doulton, Wedgwood etc., are Staffordshire Oatcakes. Once only eaten locally, the Staffordshire Oatcake has grown steadily in popularity over recent years. The traditional filling would be practically any combination of ingredients from an ‘all-day breakfast’ but anything goes these days. Chicken curry, chilli con carne, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and coronation chicken are now quite the norm amongst the oatcake avant-garde, as well as golden syrup, honey, jam and cream.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/42/10/79/pic3l1PQH.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/42/10/79/pic93A4cZ.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/42/10/79/picm1SzQ3.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/42/10/79/pick35CaB.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/42/10/79/picgRdDlS.jpg""

I now have the answer.......Browsing through Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 2; I found this historical note about Pommes Anna: &quot;It was created during the era of Napoleon III and named, as were many culinary triumphs in those days, after one of the grandes cocottes of the period. Whether it was an Anna Deslions, an Anna Judic, or simply Anna Untel, she has also immortalized the special double baking dish itself, la cocotte a pommes Anna, which is still made and which you can still buy at a fancy price&quot;. Sounds like a mandatory piece of kitchenware for all dedicated chefs and cooks to me!! This simple recipe is all in the preparation and presentation, and the use of very, very thinly sliced potatoes, that's the key to success. Since the dish is inverted, it is important that the first layer of potatoes be attractively arranged. Select perfect slices, and overlap them carefully. It is best cooked in a copper or cast iron omelette pan. If you don't have an &quot;omelette pan&quot; which is ovenproof, use a deep pie plate. Keep in mind the final shape makes the presentation. A watercress or parsley garnish adds colour. Serve warm and cut into wedges, like a cake or quiche.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/84/69/5oIdelJSxG2THBWlfeNe_pommes-anna-gratin-potato_1938.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/84/69/sLnc6IjxT18rB3UTaMHN_pommes-anna-gratin-potato_1918.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/84/69/KjCH553xSBW4cj8EkN5V_pommes-anna-gratin-potato_1968.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/84/69/0h6R8lBVSbaXjuThuBrf_Potato%20Anna.JPG"",

Everyone just loved this cake, including my 3 1/2 year old grandson. It is time-consuming to make, but worth it.  A wonderful rich-tasting cake with a light sponge cake,strawberry mousse filling, and white chocolate.  I used the white morsels in the store because I couldn't find the white chocolate and used Kittencals pan release instead of parchment paper Recipe #78579.  I also used cake flour substitute Recipe #87689.  I made the cake with the mousse and put it in the refrigerator overnight and frosted it the next morning and refrigerated for a few hours before cutting.     I put sliced almonds on the sides after frosting.  The next time I think I'll try frosting 1/2 of the cake with white chocolate ganache and the other 1/2 with chocolate ganache.   If you want something special and you like white chocolate and strawberry mousse, this is for you.  Here's the link:

Add some coleslaw (vinegar based) for a bit healthier slaw;  and maybe a lite potato salad. A healthy take on classic recipe. These will make about 8 large cakes (depending on the size you make). You can always double the recipe if you have more guests as I normally serve 2-3 cakes per person depending on the size.  You can also make them smaller and serve them as an appetizer.

Bring to medium heat, a nice simmer and add the catfish. You don't want it boiling and you don't want the catfish swimming in it. Just a little on the bottom that will lightly cook the fish.

It is adapted from the pancake recipe in The Joy of Cooking (the JOC recipe has 1 T more butter and uses white flour instead of whole wheat flour).  

I don't recommend whole wheat baking without using a wheat grinder... there is such a huge difference in quality, performance, and taste if you buy whole wheat flour instead of using a wheat grinder to mill whole wheat.  I have tried both.  This is an investment that can help you enjoy healthy, delicious, whole grain foods for years to come!

Another thing to know about whole wheat flour versus freshly milled whole wheat is that the freshly milled whole wheat is much more nutrient rich than &quot;whole wheat flour&quot;.  Wheat is like fruit, once you cut it open, you can't leave it out for a long time because its quality immediately begins to deteriorate.

I noticed pudding is less popular than cake, and of course, cake is more suited for parties, especially those with kids. You can use your choice of cake flavor, but pay attention to the cookie crumbs you use in that case so they are compatible flavors. You also probably wouldn't want to use chocolate icing with a pumpkin cake, but if you wanted a pumpkin frosting, that would be good, or else use vanilla.You can use whipped cream to make the ghosties, but be aware that if you do this, the cake needs to remain chilled, and the whipped cream does try to sag and run after awhile (so don't do that too far in advance). The marshmallow ghosties are more durable at room temp.
